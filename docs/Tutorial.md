title: My Rust Tutorial
---

# Goal

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a number guesser in Rust. For those who want to take a deeper dive, you will learn how to perform read/write with an external file. 

# Previous Knowledge

Rust is a system language. It is lower-level than, say, C# for example. Still, this tutorial welcomes everyone who's familiar with one procedural language (C#/Javascript/Python/where-code-goes-one-by-one) and program flow understandment (like if-else cases, loops and functions) and who wants to (and their patience) with ambigous syntax and lower-level code.  

This language will be familiar to C# users for it has similar syntax. It also will deny compiling if you got an error, which isn't the case in Javascript.
Though, if you wrote a program before, you're good to go. 

# What you'll learn

Your Rust adventure goes in following order:
- Necessaries for Rust development/Environment Setup 
    - cargo
    - Rust Syntax
    - rust-analyzer
    - rust debugger: CodeLLDB
- Data and Types
- While, if-else
- Functions


(
First I'll show you necessaries for your environment. I recommend VSC.

This way you will safely compile a "Hello World" program.
Then we will move focus to data types.
Then a short trip to while, if-else
Next there will be explanation on functions
)

# Tutorial

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("This is a code snippet using ```")
```
